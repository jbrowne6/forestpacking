csv file format--
    Number of Trees
    Number of Classes
    Then for each tree:
        Number of Nodes in tree
        treeMap, 1 for each node in tree
        CutPoints, 1 for each node in tree
        Which class, 1 for each node in tree
        Which feature, 1 for each node in tree

properties of trees--
    number of inner nodes = (number nodes in tree -1)/2
    number of values for tree = 1 + number nodes *2 + number of inner nodes (see rationale)
    rationale = (1 for the number of nodes), (Each node shows in tree map), (each inner node has a cut point), (each inner node has a feature), (each leaf has a class)
